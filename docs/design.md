### Docusaurus

![Docusaurus](/img/docusauruslogo.png)

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) development framework.
Several other [Development Frameworks](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools) and other static site generators are available.

Docusaurus is:

- Modern [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) documentation site
- A Single Page Application (SPA) is a single web page, website, or web application that works within a web browser and loads just a single document. It does not need page reloading during its usage, and most of its content remains the same while only some of it needs updating. When the content needs to be updated, the SPA does it through JavaScript APIs.
- Abstracts the full power of [React](programming#react), [MDX](programming#mdx), and [JSX](programming#react-jsx), for creating user interfaces.

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator. It is created and open-sourced by [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/)
