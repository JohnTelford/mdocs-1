# Creating a Site

!!! note

    This site is built using [Materials for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)


```pip install mkdocs-material```

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies: MkDocs, Markdown, Pygments and Python Markdown Extensions. Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately.

```mkdocs build```

```mkdocs serve```
