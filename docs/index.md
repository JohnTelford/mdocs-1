# Iterative Development

---

!!! Abstract

    Creating and maintaining websites that meet users needs are, complex, difficult, and time consuming.

---

## Introduction

This website created by [johntelford.com LLC](Company), is about optimizing website project life time costs using Iterative Development, Web Component Technologies, and static site generator for developing websites.

---

Developers working on website features, fixes, or testing can deploy private [Preview](deploy#preview) Internet websites with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the website production version enabling stakeholders to monitor progress and quickly give feedback, speeding up the development process.

---

The slightest errors during development will require [Defect Remediation Costs](siteoverview#defect-remediation-costs) sometime during the life time of the website. The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects.

Content and software defects cost less when found early during development

---

This website is being created and maintained by the technologies described.
