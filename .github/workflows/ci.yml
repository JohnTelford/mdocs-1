=== "Material for MkDocs"

``` yaml
name: ci # (1)!
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # (2)!
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x
      - run: pip install mkdocs-material # (3)!
      - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

1.  You can change the name to your liking. 

2.  At some point, GitHub renamed `master` to `main`. If your default branch
    is named `master`, you can safely remove `main`, vice versa.

3.  This is the place to install further [MkDocs plugins] or Markdown
    extensions with `pip` to be used during the build:

    ``` sh
    pip install \
      mkdocs-material \
      mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin \
      ...
    ```
